# Tanstack Boilerplate

This is a personal boilerplate to jumpstart new projects.

**It's node only and will not work for serverless deployments, as this requires a long running server for things like cron jobs and sockets.**

## Already done

- Tanstack Start, Router, Query
- Shadcn UI
- Tailwind CSS
- Light & Dark mode (next-themes <- yes this works here too, as its not using next specific APIs)
- Lucia Auth (github & discord sso)
- Simple onboarding flow after first signup (to set name & team name)
- SQLite
- Drizzle ORM
- Emails (Resend & React Email)
- Cron jobs & background jobs (BullMQ)
