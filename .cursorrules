## Project Context

A comprehensive boilerplate project to jumpstart new React applications with
modern tooling and best practices.

- Type-safe full-stack development with TanStack
- Modern authentication with GitHub/Discord SSO
- Hybrid database approach:
  - Local: Direct SQLite for development
  - Production: Turso for global distribution
- Component library with shadcn/ui
- Comprehensive testing setup

## Tech Stack

- React 19
- TanStack (Router, Query, Start)
- TypeScript
- SQLite (local) / Turso (production) with Drizzle ORM
- Better-auth with GitHub/Discord SSO
- TailwindCSS with shadcn/ui
- trigger.dev for background jobs
- Fly.io for deployment and hosting
- vitest for testing
- valibot for type-safe validation

## Code Style and Structure

- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes
- Prefer duplicating code over premature abstraction (Write Everything Twice
  principle)
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading,
  hasError)
- Structure repository files as follows:

```
src/
├── components/     # Shared UI components
├── data/          # Data layer utilities
├── drizzle/       # Database schemas and migrations
├── features/      # Feature-specific code
│   └── feature-name/
│       ├── ui/         # UI components
│       ├── api/        # Server functions + React Query
│       ├── domain/     # Business logic + DB operations
│       └── templates/  # Templates
├── hooks/         # Shared React hooks
├── lib/           # Shared utilities
├── routes/        # Route components
├── styles/        # Global styles
├── tasks/         # Background tasks
└── tests/         # Test utilities and mocks
```

## Naming Conventions

- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/form-wizard)
- Favor named exports for components and utilities
- Component files: component-name.tsx
- Server/API files:
  - Server logic: module-name.server.ts
  - API layer: module-name.api.ts

## Initial Workflow Analysis

IMPORTANT: At the start of EVERY new conversation:

1. Read `docs/workflow.md` FIRST
2. CREATE a plan that:
   - Lists relevant workflow sections for this task
   - Explains which parts can be skipped
   - Lists implementation steps
3. Get user confirmation before proceeding

If unsure about anything, ask for clarification.
