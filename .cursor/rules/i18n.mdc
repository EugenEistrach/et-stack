# Internationalization (i18n) Guidelines

## Usage

Import and use translations in client components:

```typescript
import * as m from '@/lib/paraglide/messages'

// Use in client components
<Button>{m.page()}</Button>
```

## Translation Keys

- Use random unique phrases ("wild_blue_snake_update": "Update")
- The main language is [en.json](mdc:messages/en.json), but please make sure you search other files in same directory and add translations there. 
- Only translate text content, not technical values

## Best Practices

- Keep translations close to where they are used
- Use semantic keys that describe the purpose
- Avoid string concatenation
- Use pluralization when needed

## Component Guidelines

- Always use translation keys for user-facing text
- Use proper pluralization rules
