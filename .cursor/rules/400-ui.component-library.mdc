description: Component library guidelines - all shadcn components are pre-installed
globs: *.tsx
---

guidelines:
  core:
    - All shadcn components are already installed
    - Import from @/components/ui/[component-name]
    - Style with Tailwind CSS
    - Use cn() utility for class merging

  workflow:
    - No need to install components - all are pre-installed
    - Import directly from @/components/ui
    - Check existing components before creating new ones

examples:
  import: |
    import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"
    import { Input } from "@/components/ui/input"

  styling: |
    import { cn } from "@/lib/utils"

    <Button
      className={cn(
        "bg-primary",
        className
      )}
    >
      Click me
    </Button>

  installation: |
    # You shouldn't need this - all components are installed
    # Only as reference if needed:
    pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add button

key_points:
  components:
    - All shadcn components pre-installed
    - Import from @/components/ui
    - Check before creating new ones

  styling:
    - Use Tailwind CSS
    - Merge classes with cn()
    - Follow Shadcn patterns
